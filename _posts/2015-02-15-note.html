				School of Data is a global network dedicated to advancing data literacy in civil society.
			</p>
			<p>
				2016 has been an exciting year for the programme, as we grew our network and increased the impact of our work. In 2015, we began a process to transition towards a more network-governed initiative. This process was continued in 2016 with the election of our second steering committee, who, together with the coordination team,  have refined the School of Data strategy as we work towards establishing ourselves as an independent organisation. 

			</p>
			<p>
				We believe that there is enormous potential in using data to improve the lives of citizens around the world, especially in increasing the transparency and accountability of governments. However, the groups who are closest to the problems – NGOs, journalists, and citizens – currently lack the skills to use data effectively as well as awareness of the potential of data for their work. Through our global network of data literacy practitioners and trainers, School of Data  seeks to address this skills gaps in order to amplify the messages of civil society through the use of data. 

			</p>
			<p>
				Over the past year, we have produced online tutorials and curricula, delivered hands-on data training across every continent, refined our training methodologies and advocated for increased data literacy in civil society. We recruited and trained nine new data leaders through our flagship fellowship programme while amplifying the impact of this programme through partnerships with topical experts.
			</p>
			<p>
				2017 is panning out to be the most exciting year yet. We will be establishing new partnerships and launching a programme to support civil society organisations and newsrooms better integrate data into their programmes. We are finalising our first multi-year strategy, which will be published in a few months. And finally, thanks to the incredibly work of our interim Steering Committee, the coordination team, Open Knowledge International and the entire network, we are ready to establish School of Data as an independent organisation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The goal is to have School of Data set up as an independent organisations by early 2018. We are working with the steering committee, our members and partners to ensure that this transition to even greater autonomy goes smoothly. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We can’t thank our wonderful, dedicated, passionate community enough; for guiding us, for holding us to high standards, for showing us where and how School of Data is needed in their communities, and for having so much fun along the way!
			</p>
			<p>
				Sincerely,
