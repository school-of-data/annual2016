						 It was thanks to Nika Aleksejeva, our School of Data 2016 Fellow, that a group in Latvia joined our network this year. Through Nika’s fellowship activities, she was able to raise awareness of the importance of data literacy in her country and a community was established soon afterwards. Already since forming in October, the group has completed some activities around the Latvian Open Data Portal and organised its first hackathon, addressing  topics including how the pharmaceutical industry impacts health care in Latvia and an analysis of variations in teacher salaries in the country.

								We are thrilled to officially welcome Connected Development to the School of Data family. School of Data has been working with Connected Development since 2014 when their co-founder, Oludotun Babayemi, became a 2014 School of Data Fellow. Since, they have continued to actively participate in the School of Data network supporting our fellows in Nigeria, organising their annual Open Data Party and advising local civil society groups on the use of data. In 2016, they participated in the Network Innovation Lab, receiving funds to launch the School of Data Radio. Connected Development is a leading civil society organisation with expertise in organising trainings and data literacy workshops, campaigning and community building.

						In France, Ecole des Données has organised three activities in Paris: a local urban data laboratory, a School of Data training and the Budget Democracy Laboratory, both for the city hall. They also developed a DatavizCard Game and coordinate a working group around data visualisation. Our French friends also took part in a series of events, such as workshops, conferences, debates and MeetUps. In 2016 they want to do more collaboration with other countries and will participate in the SuperDemain (digital culture for children and families) and Futur en Seien 2016 events</p>

						Latin American Escuela de Datos, coordinated by SocialTIC, in Mexico had two fellows Camila Salazar (Costa Rica) and Julio Lopez (Ecuador), who both did amazing things in the region, such as organasing 23 training events in four different countries (Ecuador, Costa Rica, Chile and Mexico), reaching out to more than 400 people. Julio is working with the Natural Resource Governance Institute on a major project about extractives data and Camila was hired by Costa Rica’s biggest data journalism team at La Nación, on top of developing a project about migrant data in the country. They’re on fire!</p>

						Down to South America we see that brasileiros at Escola de Dados, in Brazil, organised 22 workshops, trainings and talks/events reaching out to over 760 people in universities, companies and even government agencies. Two of their intructors were invited by the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas to organise and run the first 100% in Portuguese MOOC about Data Journalism, with the support from the National Newspaper Association and Google. In total, a staggering 5000 people enrolled for the course, a massive success. They also organised a data analysis course for Folha de S.Paulo, biggest broadsheet newspaper in the country. Next year is looking even better, according to Natália Mazotte, Escola de Dado’s coordinator. “We will be offering more courses with the Knight Center, will create data labs inside Rio de Janeiro favelas and will run our own fellowship program”. Outstanding!
