						 It was thanks to Nika Aleksejeva, our School of Data 2016 Fellow, that a group in Latvia joined our network this year. Through Nika’s fellowship activities, she was able to raise awareness of the importance of data literacy in her country and a community was established soon afterwards. Already since forming in October, the group has completed some activities around the Latvian Open Data Portal and organised its first hackathon, addressing  topics including how the pharmaceutical industry impacts health care in Latvia and an analysis of variations in teacher salaries in the country.
