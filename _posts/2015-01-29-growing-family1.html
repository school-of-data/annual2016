						The great team at Code for South Africa coordinated the activities of three open data fellows and are organising the first physical Data Journalism School of the continent! For the first time in Africa, there will be a dedicated space for people to work together with on-site support on data journalism skills. But they didn’t stop it there. They also participated in the Africa Open Data Conference, coordinated trainings and skillshares with NU & BlackSash and ran two three-day Bootcamps (Cape Town and Johannesburg).

						In 2015, our friends at Metamorphosis Foundation <a href="http://schoolofdata.metamorphosis.org.mk/" target="_blank">launched their School of Data website</a>, 100% in Macedonian, with the support of their second School of Data Fellow, Goran Rizaov. Together with Dona Djambaska, senior fellow (class of 2014), they organised four open data meetups, and two 2-day open data trainings, including a data journalism workshop with local journalists in Skopje. They also launched a call for applications that resulted in Goran supporting three local NGOs in open data projects. The Institute for Rural Communities and the PIU Institute also received support from the with data clinics. And if that was not enough, Dona and Goran were special guests speakers at the TEDxBASSalon.

In Spain, Escuela de Datos participated in a data journalism conference leading workshops for three days and a hackathon. They also ran monthly meeting with people interested in exploring data; they call it “open data maker nights” and also our own data expeditions. Greece organised an open science training event and also servers as the itersection between open data and linked data, coming from people working at the University of Greece.

						In France, Ecole des Données has organised three activities in Paris: a local urban data laboratory, a School of Data training and the Budget Democracy Laboratory, both for the city hall. They also developed a DatavizCard Game and coordinate a working group around data visualisation. Our French friends also took part in a series of events, such as workshops, conferences, debates and MeetUps. In 2016 they want to do more collaboration with other countries and will participate in the SuperDemain (digital culture for children and families) and Futur en Seien 2016 events</p>

						Latin American Escuela de Datos, coordinated by SocialTIC, in Mexico had two fellows Camila Salazar (Costa Rica) and Julio Lopez (Ecuador), who both did amazing things in the region, such as organasing 23 training events in four different countries (Ecuador, Costa Rica, Chile and Mexico), reaching out to more than 400 people. Julio is working with the Natural Resource Governance Institute on a major project about extractives data and Camila was hired by Costa Rica’s biggest data journalism team at La Nación, on top of developing a project about migrant data in the country. They’re on fire!</p>

						Down to South America we see that brasileiros at Escola de Dados, in Brazil, organised 22 workshops, trainings and talks/events reaching out to over 760 people in universities, companies and even government agencies. Two of their intructors were invited by the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas to organise and run the first 100% in Portuguese MOOC about Data Journalism, with the support from the National Newspaper Association and Google. In total, a staggering 5000 people enrolled for the course, a massive success. They also organised a data analysis course for Folha de S.Paulo, biggest broadsheet newspaper in the country. Next year is looking even better, according to Natália Mazotte, Escola de Dado’s coordinator. “We will be offering more courses with the Knight Center, will create data labs inside Rio de Janeiro favelas and will run our own fellowship program”. Outstanding!
