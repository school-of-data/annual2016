							 In 2016, we launched the Network Lab, a network-centered programme designed to enable members to pursue innovative projects, strategically important to the growth of the network as a whole. The support provided by the School of Data coordination team takes multiple forms, from seed-funding to joint writing of grant proposals, to ad-hoc project advice. In 2016 we launched a first call for proposal to select 6 projects from our network members, both organisations and individuals. Selected projects included a data visualisation card game, a radio series about data literacy, a project about data literacy in Brazilian favelas, a project about Education Data Advocacy in Colombia, a tool to search multiple ckan instances (to be used during the "FIND" step of data expeditions), and a series of templates to better evaluate data literacy workshops.
