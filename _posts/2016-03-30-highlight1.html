							In 2016, we launched Network Lab, a seed-funding scheme designed to enable members to pursue innovative projects, strategically important to the growth of the network as a whole. Our call for proposals went out to individual and organisational members, as well as existing local implementation partners.
						</p>
						<p>
							Of the six grantees this year, projects included a data visualisation card game, a radio series about data literacy, a project about data literacy in Brazilian favelas, a project about Education Data Advocacy in Colombia, a tool to search multiple ckan instances (to be used during the "FIND" step of data expeditions), and a series of templates to better evaluate data literacy workshops.
						</p>
						<p>
							With this new programme, we hope to allow our members to bring data literacy to their localities in engaging, fresh and innovative ways.
