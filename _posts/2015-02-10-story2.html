							School of Data held our third annual Summer Camp in São Paulo (Ibiúna), Brazil. The five day event brought together School of Data Members, Senior Fellows and new fellows for an intensive week of training, planning, skillshares and collaboration. The Summer Camp is our only opportunity to be together as a network and we made the most of the five days. We introduced new fellows to our training methodologies and helped them set goals and define a work plan  for their fellowship.  We learned about new tools, ran deep dives on specific themes and shared best practices and resources. In the governance track, we continued our work to define our objectives as a global network and elected our first permanent steering committee. Following the Summer Camp, Escola de Dados organised an open Data Journalism Event in Sao Paulo with talks from members of the entire School of Data family.
