						SCHOOL OF DATA FELLOWSHIP
					</h3>
					<p>
						We started the Fellowship programme in a pilot in 2013, as a response to this question: how to ensure sustainable, long term impact if School of Data trainers are only present on the ground for short periods of time? Answer: Long term engagement, from people who are already in those communities.
					</p>
					<p>
						Building on top of the spectacular experience we had last year, with wonderful results, the 2015 School of Data Fellowship was also a staggering success.
					</p>
					<p>
						More than 1000 people trained over 40 training events in 8 countries. Beyond the hands-on training event in various countries, they produced a great amount of free CC-BY content freely available to anyone in the world: 26 blog posts, 8 skillshares, 6 learning modules.
					</p>
					<p>
						We're very proud of our 2015 class and we can't wait to have them mingle with our upcoming 2016 class!
