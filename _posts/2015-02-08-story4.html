							Together with the European Center for Journalism, School of Data organised for the 4th year the biggest European Data Journalism event: the School of Data Journalism. The 2015 edition took place in Perugia, Italy between 15 – 19 of April as part of the International Journalism Festival. Senior fellows <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/ritazagoni" target="_blank">Rita Zagoni</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/codrinai" target="_blank">Codrina Ilie</a> were there running sessions and expeditions.
						</p>
						<p>
							The School was invitation for beginners and experienced journalists to tell stories through data – a field of work growing and gaining in importance. A team of about 15 expert panelists and instructors from New York Times, Guardian, Twitter, Journalism++, Knight-Mozilla, School of Data and others lead participants in a mix of discussions and hands-on sessions aimed to empower participants with the skills they need to produce high quality data stories. The topics ranged from revenue models for data driven newsrooms to sensor data, web scraping and social media data, basic design and visualisation tips and mapping techniques for journalism.
